How to run it as a simulator?

- Make rendering optional.
- Tick as fast as possible (or slower for visual replays).
- Every tick has an option input event / action by agent.


Main Action types:
- None (just tick and other agents can still execute actions).
- arrow keys
- pause
- quit

Inputs for the simulator?
- Run
- Pause
- Step forward
- Step backwards


Command line options:
- `--record` Save all input actions with timestamp to file.
- `--nogui` Run headless, without rendering to the screen. (This means you cannot play with keyboard input.)
- `--replay` Replay from recording.
